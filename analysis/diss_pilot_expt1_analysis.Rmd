```{r setup, include=FALSE}

dir_proj <- here::here()
dir_data <- fs::path(dir_proj, "data")

df = read.csv(

## Research questions
Everyone will predict that they do better with reread 
(avg prediction reread, avg prediction generate)
Split by #/% correct or incorrect on strategy, and/or relative performance on strategies A/B 
```{r}
# remove duplicates long data
# interventionPredictRestudy
# interventionPredictGenerate
```


In fact, everyone will do better with generate (interventionTest accuracy)
```{r}

```


Expt vs. control
Intervention folks will have longer reveal latency
Split by later correct or incorrect
shorter moveOn latency?
Split by later correct or incorrect
Better assessmentTest accuracy

Expt-match-expectations vs. expt-nonmatch vs. control
Would expect those who predicted the opposite to change the most
Discrepancy
Would expect those with bigger discrepancies to move more toward a generate (or restudy) profile

(Expt vs. control, secondary analysis)
Cluster response types, and compare # of each type in expt vs. control
Taxonomy 1: short-short, short-long, long-short, long-long
Taxonomy 2: clustering with k-means



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
